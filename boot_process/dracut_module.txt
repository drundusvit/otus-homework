1. Copy module-setup.sh and test.sh scripts into created /usr/lib/dracut/modules.d/01test and make them executable

2. Change initrd image:

dracut -fv

[root@lvm 01test]# dracut -fv
Executing: /sbin/dracut -fv

3. Check if new module is installed

[root@lvm 01test]# lsinitrd -m /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r).img | grep test
test

4. Delete splash and quiet commands from /boot/grub2/grub.cfg and restart the host in order to see the pinguin.
